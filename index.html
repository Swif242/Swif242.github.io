        <p class="text-wrap" class="card-text"> My name is Jeremy, I was born and raised in Tucson, AZ. I
          am aspiring to be a full stack<strong> Web Developer</strong>. Theres something about taking a bunch of text
          on
          a
          screen that looks like gibberish to the average person and turning it into a functioning website or program,
          almost like magic! I am the kind of person that likes to build
          things with my hands and implement different ideas on how to build things from scratch or fix things when they
          break I like to figure out how things work. Since I was a kid I enjoyed computers and gadgets, I would always
          try to tinker with the settings and see what changed. After I got bored with what the manufacture settings had
          to offer,
          a couple of my close friends and I wanted to see what else we can make different devices do, so we did a lot
          of
          digging
          and with some trial and error we were able to basically hack things like the old cellphones and old PSP first gens  , we made custom
          icons/themes and
          using the built in IR sensor turned it into a homemade universal remote control,<em>ya know just kid
            stuff</em>.</p>
        <p class="text-wrap" class="card-text">
          Even though i've always had an interest in electronics my main passion growing up has always been in anything that has an
          engine and a gas tank.
          I taught
          myself how to fix and build old dirt-bikes an ATV's, until I got older and started building and modifying my
          own cars. The skills i've learned working 
          in the automotive industry are similar to the type of skills used in coding, such as debugging and diagnosing
          problems
          through either reverse engineering or rebuilding from scratch, and to me both are kinda like building a very
          complex puzzle that you really need
          to be able to visualize and experiment as you build.
